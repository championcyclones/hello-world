# hello-world
My first repository!

I taught myself how to code in HTML many years ago, picked up just enough CSS and ASP to be dangerous and then...I didn't have the time to follow up and continue learning to code.  Fast forward 15 years or so and I am trying to get back in the saddle.  I have recently stumbled across DevTips by Travis Neilson and had my passion reignited!  Hoping to build great things...or at least things I like!

:P
